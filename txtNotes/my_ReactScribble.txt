+++ ADD POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS: +++
- tokenAuth so after refresh we are kept on the same page (not returned back to /login) -> DONE
- add date of birth as parameter in "+ Add user" (dateTime picker) -> DONE
- if we click on user, zoom it in and display more info (e.g. username, birth date) -> DONE

- add "infinite scroll" (load more) for users (maybe load 6 or 8 at the time)
- fix Search margin from the left side (Users and Search touch when scaled to minimum)
- add option to /login to login as FB or Gmail user
- add option for +Add User to insert phone number (include Country number as dropdown option)
- ? add drop down with roles for users
- ? add regular, plus, premium user so it can access different things in app
- ? add "send email / sms" with some kind of built in template of email already ready for use
- implement some backend task
